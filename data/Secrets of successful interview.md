Hi there!

New week - new article!

A few days ago I was asked how to successfully pass the interview and receive the offer from the company. I will not guarantee that you will receive the offer, but these recommendations based on my own experience might help you.

## Common questions ##
I suggest you prepare a list of the most common questions, which are usually asked at each interview. I suggest you this article:  [https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/interview-questions-net-developer/](https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/interview-questions-net-developer/ "Interview questions .NET developer"){target="_blank"} , which contains 150+ questions. This is probably the largest list of questions I have come across.

## My questions database ##
At the interview, in any case, there will be questions that cannot be answered. This is normal. It would be better to remember these questions and make your list for the future. So in the next interview, you should already know the answer.

## CV preparation ##
You don't need to write everything you have ever used. No need to write like Windows, Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe Photoshop version 6, etc. It will be better if you add it during an interview if you are asked.

You need to write what you are really sure of.
It is better to divide by categories: programming language, databases, version control systems, etc.
You can generate a resume on LinkedIn.

You can add the most recent education, do not write the school or kindergarten you visited :-)

## Projects ##
If you just starting your career, and do not have real client experience, you can add your diploma graduation work. (I hope it is something bigger than "Hello World")

When the interviewers look at the project, they understand the systems you worked on and start asking you about these topics. Otherwise, there will be a very abstract interview.

Projects you write from the very last to the first. Without disclosing of course information about the client.

## Project expectation ##
Probably the most important thing. You should like the project. If you understand already at the interview stage that you will not be very interested in this, then it is better to say about it. Identify your priorities and expectations. What do you expect from the project? And then watch how much it rushes.

For example, you are applying for a front end developer
And the interviewer tells you: "We have many tasks on the back. So how do you feel about spending 70% of your time on the backend on Java?"

## Be ready for the practical part ##
There are 2 types of practice tests. 
The first is "Sketch in 5 minutes on your knees".

For example, you have 4 points - the vertices of a rectangle. Check if point A belongs to the rectangle. Then the interviewer may ask: How would you optimize this code?  What if the number is negative? How would you test this code?

The second variant is larger test tasks. It is important to create scalable, optimized, readable, and testable solutions.
This task may take from several hours to several days. You then send it back to the reviewers and they send you the result.

Practical questions don't have to be. Pay more attention to theory. You will learn to write code over time.
Nobody will demand super solutions from you if you are a Junior.

## Questions ##
And the most important thing. Before the interview, check the basic information about the company and the project. In the end, the interviewer will tell you: Thanks for the interview. Do you have any questions?

And here it is very important to ask something. Show your interest. You can ask about the team. You can ask about how the processes are built, etc. Basically, everything that interests you.
